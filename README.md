Easy res switching in tray for HTPC, so we can take advantage of TV's scaling on 1080p content when displayed on a 4K TV, but also have option of getting full 4K quality on 4K content.

Before using, set cursor scheme to `Windows Default (Extra Large)` in main.cpl mouse settings, for better visibility on a TV. Windows will automatically scale the cursor size to be the same for each dpi/res combo. 

For personal use. Known issues:

- Right click > Exit on tray icon registers as an actual click so changes res

- Hardcoded paths
